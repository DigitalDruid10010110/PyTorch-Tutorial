# PyTorch Tutorial Project

This repository contains code and exercises from my journey through the **Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz**. It serves as a personal learning project to build and experiment with neural networks using PyTorch.

Online tutorial used: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

## ðŸ“‹ Contents
- `test-pytorch.py`: Test script to verify the PyTorch installation.
- `01_tensors.py`: Working with tensors in PyTorch.
- `02_tensor_attrib.py`: Example of a linear layer in PyTorch.
- More scripts coming soon as I progress!

## ðŸš€ Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Learn the basics of PyTorch and neural networks.
- Build practical skills through hands-on coding exercises.
- Track my progress and build a coding portfolio.

## ðŸ’» How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PyTorch-Tutorial.git
   cd PyTorch-Tutorial
2. **Set up the environment and install dependencies**:  
   If you donâ€™t already have the required packages, you will need to set up a virtual environment and install them.

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Activate the environment (Windows)
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install required packages
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

3. **Verify your installation by running**:
    ```bash
    # python test_pytorch.py
